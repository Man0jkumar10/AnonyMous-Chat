I want you to build me a real-time anonymous random chat application like Omegle, but only with text chat (no accounts).

Requirements:

When a user opens the site, they click a "Start" button to find a random partner.

The backend matches them with another waiting user and creates a private chat room.

Messages are sent instantly in real-time using WebSockets.

When either person leaves, the chat room is destroyed and all messages are erased from memory (no database storage).

There should be a "Leave" button that disconnects from the current chat and optionally lets them search for a new partner.

Keep the code simple and modular, using proper folder structure.

Use only temporary in-memory data for matching users.

Frontend should have a minimal UI with:

Chat area showing sent/received messages

Input field and Send button

Start Chat & Leave Chat buttons

Show "Waiting for a partner..." while searching

Must work in real-time with low latency.

Technologies to use:

Frontend: React.js, Socket.IO client, TailwindCSS for styling

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO for real-time messaging

Hosting: Node backend can run on Render/Heroku, React frontend can be deployed on Vercel/Netlify

No database (store active chats only in server memory)

Features to implement:

Matchmaking system: use a simple queue to store one waiting user at a time

Room creation: when two users match, create a room ID and join both users to it

Real-time chat: emit message events to both users in the same room

Disconnect handling: if one user leaves, inform the other and destroy the room

Auto-cleanup: ensure memory is cleared when users leave or disconnect

Deliverables:

server.js file for backend with matchmaking and chat logic

client/ folder for React app with components for Start, Chat, and Leave functionality

Code should be ready to run locally (npm install then npm start)

Use clear comments for important logic parts

Extra (optional):

Add a "Next" button to skip current partner and find a new one

Add typing indicators ("User is typing...")

Add chat time limit per session
